### ⚙️ Reverse Engineering of an Angle Grinder

**Summary:**
Analyzed and modeled the internal design, materials, and manufacturing processes of a commercial angle grinder. Focused on improving the armature shaft design for better durability and manufacturability.

**My Role:** Lead analyst and CAD modeller

**Technologies Used:** SolidWorks, materials analysis, tolerance studies

**GitHub Repo:** [View Project](#)

**Key Achievements / Outcome:**

- Produced a manufacturable redesign with suggested process changes (forging + machining).
- Documented tolerance and heat-treatment recommendations.
