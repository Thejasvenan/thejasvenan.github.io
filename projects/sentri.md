### 🤖 SENTRI — Automated Pickup & Cleaning Robot

**Summary:**
SENTRI is an autonomous robot designed to navigate cafeteria tables and collect leftover bottles. The system integrates perception (YOLOv8n-based object detection), navigation control, and a simple pickup mechanism to perform table-level cleaning tasks.

**My Role:** System designer & Computer Vision developer

**Technologies Used:** Raspberry Pi, Arduino Uno, Python (OpenCV, YOLOv8n), Arduino C, DC motors, motor drivers

**GitHub Repo:** [View Project](https://github.com/your-username/sentri)

**Key Achievements / Outcome:**

- Built and tuned a vision pipeline that works under mixed indoor lighting.
- Implemented robust pickup behavior with sensor feedback.
- Demonstrated the integrated prototype in live cafeteria trials.
