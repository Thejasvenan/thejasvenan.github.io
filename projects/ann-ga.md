### 🧬 Artificial Neural Network Trained using Genetic Algorithm

**Summary:**
Implemented an Artificial Neural Network whose weights are optimized using a Genetic Algorithm. The project explores alternative training approaches to improve convergence and to escape local minima typical in gradient-based methods.

**My Role:** Algorithm developer and experimenter

**Technologies Used:** C++, numerical optimization, evolutionary strategies

**GitHub Repo:** [View Project](#)

**Key Achievements / Outcome:**

- Implemented chromosome encoding for neural weights and mutation/crossover strategies.
- Demonstrated improved robustness on synthetic benchmark datasets.
